
Closure---

Closure gives us the access to an outer function scope from an inner function and the closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Index: ' + i + ', element: ' + arr[i]);
	
  }, 3000);
}

Here, setTimeOut function in self invoking function.The setTimeout function creates a function that has access to its outer scope, which is the for loop with index i.
The function is executed and prints the value of i, and at the end of the loop is at 4 because it cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
and the loop finally stops at 4.arr[4] does not exist, which is why you get undefined.
